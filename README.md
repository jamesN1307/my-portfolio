This is my personal personal portfolio that was created with html and css. In the header section you will see a picture of seattle which is where i live and links that will direct you to the section of the web page. In the main section you will see some of the program that we are learning in our bootcamp class which include html, css java script, mysql, etc. On the footer you will be able to fill out your name and link that will direct you to different way to contact me email, youtube or github.
